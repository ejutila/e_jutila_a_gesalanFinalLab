            <p class="lb_text">
                After a brutal 6-2 loss in its opener against England, Iran bounced back to beat Wales, 2-0, scoring both goals in extra time. Iran has never made it past the group stage in a World Cup but is now in a position to do just that. 
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                A win against the U.S. would be enough for the Iranians to advance. Even a draw might be enough. Iran would advance with a draw unless Wales defeated England.
